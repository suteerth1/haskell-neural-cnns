# Haskell Neural Networks

## Who
The contributors of this project are Kevin Chen and Suteerth Vishnu.

## Goal
The goal of this project is demonstrating that Haskell's powerful abstractions allow for the implementation of sophisticated network architectures which would be difficult to do with standard approaches (i.e Tensorflow/Pytorch).

First, we seek to improve upon canonical MNIST example for the **neural** library developed by Lars Br√ºnjes, using convolutional neural networks. If time provides, we seek to either create further examples for other datasets and network architectures, submit open-source additions to the neural library, or create our own wrapper/addons to increase the library's functionality.
