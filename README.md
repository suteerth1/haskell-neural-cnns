# Haskell Neural Networks

### Project Description
**Contributors:** Kevin Chen and Suteerth Vishnu of the University of Maryland, College Park.
**Intention:** Demonstrate that Haskell's powerful abstractions allow for the implementation of sophisticated network architectures which would be difficult to do with standard approaches (i.e Tensorflow/Pytorch).
#### Concrete Goals
- Improve upon canonical MNIST example for the **neural** library developed by Lars Br√ºnjes, using convolutional neural networks.
#### Reach Goals (if time permits)
- Create further examples for other datasets and network architectures
- Submit open-source additions to the neural library
- reate our own wrapper/addons to increase the library's functionality.
